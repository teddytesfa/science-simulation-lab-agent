# What the student needs to find
targets:

    description: Maximum height reached by the projectile
    type: numeric
    unit: m
    tolerance: 0.1
    
  - id: range

# Hints to help the student
hints:
  - text: "Remember that horizontal and vertical motions are independent."
    triggers: ["horizontal", "vertical", "motion"]
    
  - text: "The maximum height depends on the vertical component of velocity."
    triggers: ["height", "vertical", "velocity"]
    
  - text: "The range depends on both the horizontal velocity and the time in the air."
    triggers: ["range", "distance", "horizontal"]

# Feedback messages
feedback:
  correct: "Great job! Your calculations are correct."
  incorrect: "Not quite. Check your calculations and try again."
  partial: "You're on the right track, but there's a small error in your calculations."
